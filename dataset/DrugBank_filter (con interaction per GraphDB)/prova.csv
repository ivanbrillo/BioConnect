DB00001,Lepirudin,Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin formed by 65 amino acids that acts as a highly specific and direct thrombin inhibitor.[L41539..L41569] Natural hirudin is an endogenous anticoagulant found in _Hirudo medicinalis_ leeches.[L41539] Lepirudin is produced in yeast cells and is identical to natural hirudin except for the absence of sulfate on the tyrosine residue at position 63 and the substitution of leucine for isoleucine at position 1 (N-terminal end).[A246609]  Lepirudin is used as an anticoagulant in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).. an immune reaction associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications.[A3.. L41539] HIT is caused by the expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that bind to the complex formed by heparin and platelet factor 4. This activates endothelial cells and platelets and enhances the formation of thrombi.[A246609] Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31.. 2012.[L41574],The acute toxicity of intravenous lepirudin was evaluated in mice (0.1-1000 mg/kg).. rats (1-1000 mg/kg).. and monkeys (1-100 mg/kg).. and toxicity was not detected at the doses investigated.[L41539] The acute toxicity of lepirudin administered subcutaneously was also evaluated in mice (1-1250 mg/kg) and rats (1-500 mg/kg).. and no toxicity was detected.[L41539] One rat (100 mg/kg) died of rapid blood loss after the subcutaneous administration of lepirudin. Reactions to local injections such as hemorrhages.. hematomas and/or nodules were detected in mice and rats given subcutaneous doses of lepirudin equal or higher than 500 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg.. respectively.[L41539] Chronic toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys given lepirudin for up to 3 months. Most of the effects observed were due to the antithrombotic action of lepirudin. After 3 months.. hemosiderin deposits in the spleen and moderate sinus histiocytosis in the lymph node were observed in rats. In monkeys.. external and internal hemorrhages and hematomas were detected.[L41539] Lepidurin was reported as not mutagenic.[L41539]Relative overdose may occur in patients with renal impairment.. therefore.. bolus dose and rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency.[L41539] Excessively high activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values suggest an overdose and a risk of bleeding. Lepirudin has no known antidote. In case of life-threatening bleeding and if excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected: 1)stop the administration of lepirudin immediately.. 2) determine aPTT and coagulation parameters.. 3) determine hemoglobin.. and prepare for a transfusion.. 4) follow the treatment guidelines for patients with shock.[L41539] Hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be useful in case of overdose.. based in single case reports and animal data.[L41539],Amino Acids..

DB01744,Camphor,Camphor is a bicyclic monoterpene ketone found widely in plants.. especially _Cinnamomum camphora_. It is used topically as a skin antipruritic and as an anti-infective agent. When ingested.. camphor has a rapid onset of toxic effects.. and camphorated oil is the product most often responsible for its toxicity. The FDA ruled that camphorated oil could not be marketed in the United States and that no product could contain a concentration higher than 11%. It appears in the list of drug products withdrawn or removed from the market for safety or effectiveness.[A254252..L43942] However.. camphor can be found in several nonprescription medications at lower concentrations.[A254252],,Anti-Infective Agents:Anti-Infective Agents..

DB00003,Dornase alfa,Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human deoxyribunuclease I (DNase I) enzyme. It is produced in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260-amino acid sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products without affecting intracellular DNA. In individuals with cystic fibrosis.. extracellular DNA.. which is an extremely viscous anion.. is released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA appears to reduce sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.,Adverse reactions occur at a frequency of < 1/1000 and are usually mild and transient in nature. Reported adverse effects include chest pain (pleuritic/non-cardiac).. fever.. dyspepsia.. voice alteration (hoarseness).. pharyngitis.. dyspnea.. laryngitis.. rhinitis.. decreased lung function.. rash.. urticaria.. and conjunctivitis. There is no evidence of carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. The safety of dornase alfa has not been studied in pregnant women.. nursing women and children under the age of 5 years old.,Amino Acids..
